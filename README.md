# `Draftsman the robot`

</div>


> A drafting robot written in C++ and Qt. Designed to teach the basics of algorithms and logical thinking through a fun approach. Designed as a tool for use as a supporting platform for school computer science and robotics clubs, it lowers the barrier to entry into programming by eliminating complex syntax and immediately showing visual results. The program motivates schoolchildren and students to study IT disciplines, fostering an interest in engineering thinking and serving as a key and simple bridge from simple games to serious programming.
